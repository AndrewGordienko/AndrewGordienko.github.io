    <h3>What is a neural network?</h3>
    <p class="u-align-left">You may have heard of neural networks as the new revolutionary idea that will create the Terminator and end us all. 
      You may also be wondering what exactly a neural network is outside of the doomsday predictions, and this is the topic of this article. <br>

      <h5>Classifications of Artificial Intelligence</h5>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence encompasses everything related to having code fulfilling a task that a human is able to  do. 
        This ranges from Youtube recommendations to tree searches for playing checkers, to a computer learning how to play the game of Go at an elite level. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Machine learning is all artificial intelligence that learns, but not necessarily with neural networks as that is the next subcategory. 
        This seems a little counterintuitive but examples of this are where nodes collect information about the state and then are backpropagated depending on the outcome. 
        For instance, tree searches are a really good example of where board states are assigned a node which is then updated depending on the outcome of playing that board. 
        By doing this the machine is able to learn how to make good moves and does not use neural networks. If you are curious about this tree search I suggest you read up 
        on the Monte Carlo Tree Search. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Deep learning is machine learning that uses neural networks. This is where all the fun stuff exists! From computer vision to natural language processing to teaching 
        AI to get really good at games or tasks, this is the subsection where all this magic resides and has neural networks as the backbone. <br>

    <h3>Cool story, but I still don't know what they really are o.o</h3>
    <p class="u-align-left">Now that you have a better understanding of where exactly neural networks come into play in the grand scheme of things for 
      artificial intelligence, you still don’t know what they really are. Let’s explan that now :). <br>

      <h5>A small carnival analogy</h5>
      <p>
        I am sure you have heard of the concept f(x) = y in math before. Basically given some input (x) you input it into a function of some form and get the output y. 
        Well, this is basically what a neural network is: you are mapping inputs to outputs and trying to find the best function for the job. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Imagine you are at a carnival and have the opportunity to drop a marble through a wooden marble run from one of nine spots and if it lands in the correct box you get 
        a prize. Neural networks are in a way similar to this but instead when the marble or input does not land inside of the right box you can tune the hyperparameters 
        in the intermediary steps. In the analogy of using a wooden marble run, this can be thought of as turning the angle of the ramps the marble slides down, 
        changing its destination. <br />
