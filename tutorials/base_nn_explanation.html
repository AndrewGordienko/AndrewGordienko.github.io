    <h3>What is a neural network?</h3>
    <p class="u-align-left">You may have heard of neural networks as the new revolutionary idea that will create the Terminator and end us all. 
      You may also be wondering what exactly a neural network is outside of the doomsday predictions, and this is the topic of this article. <br>

      <h5>Classifications of Artificial Intelligence</h5>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence encompasses everything related to having code fulfilling a task that a human is able to  do. 
        This ranges from Youtube recommendations to tree searches for playing checkers, to a computer learning how to play the game of Go at an elite level. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Machine learning is all artificial intelligence that learns, but not necessarily with neural networks as that is the next subcategory. 
        This seems a little counterintuitive but examples of this are where nodes collect information about the state and then are backpropagated depending on the outcome. 
        For instance, tree searches are a really good example of where board states are assigned a node which is then updated depending on the outcome of playing that board. 
        By doing this the machine is able to learn how to make good moves and does not use neural networks. If you are curious about this tree search I suggest you read up 
        on the Monte Carlo Tree Search. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Deep learning is machine learning that uses neural networks. This is where all the fun stuff exists! From computer vision to natural language processing to teaching 
        AI to get really good at games or tasks, this is the subsection where all this magic resides and has neural networks as the backbone. <br>

    <h3>Cool story, but I still don't know what they really are o.o</h3>
    <p class="u-align-left">Now that you have a better understanding of where exactly neural networks come into play in the grand scheme of things for 
      artificial intelligence, you still don’t know what they really are. Let’s explan that now :). <br>

      <h5>A small carnival analogy</h5>
      <p>
        I am sure you have heard of the concept f(x) = y in math before. Basically given some input (x) you input it into a function of some form and get the output y. 
        Well, this is basically what a neural network is: you are mapping inputs to outputs and trying to find the best function for the job. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Imagine you are at a carnival and have the opportunity to drop a marble through a wooden marble run from one of nine spots and if it lands in the correct box you get 
        a prize. Neural networks are in a way similar to this but instead when the marble or input does not land inside of the right box you can tune the hyperparameters 
        in the intermediary steps. In the analogy of using a wooden marble run, this can be thought of as turning the angle of the ramps the marble slides down, 
        changing its destination. <br />

    <h3>Let’s look at two more cases that will clarify this further.</h3>
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-container halves u-align-left">
    <div class="left">
      <h5>Learning about perceptrons</h5>
      <p>
        The first case is called a perceptron. Imagine that you have two input nodes that connect directly to the output node with string. 
        Each string has a weight associated with it of how much to magnify the number that the input node is set to. The weight can be 5 or 0.2, or any other number. 
        Each step of the journey along the way between sets of nodes also has something called a bias. Now you are probably thinking, wow that’s so incredibly boring, 
        and why should I care about these weights and biases! To that, I say: remember that neural networks are the backbone for all learning-related AI use cases, 
        and let’s talk about why weights and biases matter now. Basically, the way to calculate the value of the output once you have weights and biases is to add up all 
        the weights, add the bias once to that sum, and then apply a fancy activation function to it that transforms the output in a constant way depending on your use case. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        Now that we have an input we can assess whether that is truly the output that we wanted. For example, say that we had an input of one and two and expected output of five,
        but instead got six - now what? Well, now we do backpropagation. Backpropagation is a whole bunch of really fancy math that is boring and difficult, 
        but what happens in the backpropagation step is that all the weights and biases are tuned just a bit to get closer to the output expected. Over time if we feed inputs 
        and outputs to the network it will be able to learn. <br>

    </div>

    <div class="right">
      <h5>Full neural network architecture</h5>
      <p>
        The second case is what happens when the input is not directly mapped to the output. In that case, we simply add more layers between the input and the output, 
        and lay strings between all the nodes, and start training once more. There are a variety of neural network architectures, each with its own pros or cons, 
        but to start a network that has some amount of inputs that connects to a layer with a thousand twenty-four nodes, that dials down to five hundred and twelve, 
        that dials down to the expected output, will get you very far and serve you well for most cases. <br /> 
        <br /> 
        This is why neural networks are so great, we can feed it pixel data of what the camera sees, and then have it output four numbers corresponding to what power level 
        the four wheels of the cars should be set to, and there are so many more use cases of this f(x) = y type of problem. From learning to master chess to self-driving 
        cars to recognizing voices, this can all be solved by using a neural network which is just a glorified function searcher for f(x) = y. <br />

    <h3>Concluding our new knowledge! O_o</h3>
    <p class="u-align-left">Hopefully, this article made quite a bit of sense, and you now have a better understanding of neural networks, and can answer what they are, 
      and why we use them :). <br>
